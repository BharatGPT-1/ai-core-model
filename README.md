# 🤖 AI Core Model (GPT-like Transformer)

**Purpose**: Implementation of the core transformer model for pretraining/fine-tuning.  
**Framework**: PyTorch/TensorFlow.  
**Features**:  
- Multi-head attention, rotary embeddings.  
- Support for LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning.  
- Optimized for multi-GPU training (FSDP/DDP).

## 🛠 Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ai-core-model
pip install -r requirements.txt  # torch, transformers, accelerate

🚀 Training
python
from core.model import GPT
model = GPT(vocab_size=50000, n_layers=12)
python train.py --config configs/base.yml
